# Automated-Expense-Tracker-Via-SMS-fetching
We often end up spending money without even realising it. Generally, we wonâ€™t be 
aware of when and why are we spending money and how much we spend.It is difficult for us 
to analyse our expenses spent on various categories manually. So, having an expense tracker 
app would help us in having control over money, setting financial goals, avoiding financial 
risks, sticking to the budget and good personal financial management. It is also difficult for 
the user to remember all his transactions. Hence, we aim to develop an automated tracking 
system which reads the transaction SMS into a mobile application and generates a timely 
report on expenses through visualization.
